=> A Binary Heap is a complete Binary Tree (All levels are filled, 
	except possibly the last level which is filled from left to right without any gaps in between).
	
=> Binary Heap is stored as an array. Left(i) = 2i+1, Right(i) = 2i+2, and Parent(i) = |(i-1)/2|.
	This way random access is possible and it is cache friendly.

=> Binary Heap is used in:
- Heap Sort
- Priority Queue : Useful in Dijkstra's shortest path, Prim's minimum spanning tree, Huffman coding etc.

=> 2 Types of Binary Heap:
- Min Heap: The parent is less than or equal to its children.
	Used to implement min-priority queue where lowest value = highest priority.
- Max Heap: The parent is greater than or equal to its children.
	Used to implement max-priority queue where highest value = highest priority.
